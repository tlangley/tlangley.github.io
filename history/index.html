<h1>NHL History</h1>
<p>The NHL started out with a failed league called the National Hockey Association(NHA). After some unresolved disputes, executives of the NHA teams suspended the NHA and, in 1917, formed the National Hockey League(NHL). The Great Depression and World War II reduced the league to six teams which became known as the Original Six. The Original Six era ended and the expansion era started with the addition of six new teams. After the league expanded from six to twenty-one teams, the NHL entered the new era, the modern era.</p>
